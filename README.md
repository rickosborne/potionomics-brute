# potionomics-brute

This code is a proof-of-concept for brute-forcing potion recipe combinations for the game [Potionomics].
As it's not intended to be a useful tool, there's no "app" here, or script to give you all the answers.

Having said that, I do think there are a few clever bits in the code.

## Speed

As is, this code is able to burn through ~500M recipe attempts per hour with a single process on my M1 Air.
Approximately 1 in every 100,000 yields a Perfect potion.

But, as the largest cauldron accepts 14 ingredients, and there are 192 ingredients total, there's no way to try every
single one:

> 206 multichoose 14 &rarr; 4,380,486,799,548,977,500,000

A laptop running overnight can generally get you into combinations of 8 ingredients.
If you're willing to target a single potion, or limit yourself to ingredients from the first chapter or two, you'll get
even more.
That'll give you several hundred thousand Perfect recipes, at least.
